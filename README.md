# **IP Tracker App**

Welcome to the IP Tracker App! This is a React-based web application that allows users to track the IP address and location of a given domain or IP address. Whether you're troubleshooting network issues or just curious about the location of a website, this app makes it easy to get the information you need.

The app uses Semantic HTML5, Flexbox, and CSS grid to create a clean and responsive user interface that is optimized for a mobile-first workflow. It also fetches data from two APIs, the Leaflet maps API and the ipfy API, to display a map of the location associated with the IP address and additional information about the domain or IP address.

This is a solution to the [IP address tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
